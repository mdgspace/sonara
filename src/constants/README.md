# Constants Directory

This directory contains constant values and configurations used throughout the Sonara synthesizer.

## Files

- **keys.js**: Contains constants for note frequencies, key mappings, and a list of musical notes used in the application.
- **path.js**: Contains constants for image paths used to represent different waveforms (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth).
- **theme.js**: Contains style-related constants such as colors, border widths, and other visual properties for the application's UI.

## Purpose

The `constants` directory is used to store static values that are shared across multiple parts of the application, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
