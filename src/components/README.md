# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable UI components for the Sonara synthesizer.

## Components

- **Keys.jsx**: Handles the piano keys for note generation.
- **Adsr.jsx**: Provides controls for the ADSR envelope (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release).
- **Equalizers.jsx**: Allows users to adjust the frequency envelope.
- **Display.jsx**: Visualizes the waveform and frequency bars.

## Purpose

The `components` directory is used to store modular and reusable UI elements that can be integrated into different parts of the application.
