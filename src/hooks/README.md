# Hooks Directory

This directory contains custom React hooks used in the Sonara synthesizer.

## Hooks

- **useCanvasDrawing.js**: Handles the drawing logic for the canvas, including nodes, curves, and frequency bars.
- **useCanvasInteraction.js**: Manages user interactions with the canvas, such as dragging nodes and adjusting curves.

## Purpose

The `hooks` directory is used to encapsulate reusable logic that can be shared across components.
